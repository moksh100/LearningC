    Let D= the number we wish to convert from decimal to binary
    Find P, such that 2^P is the largest power of two smaller than D.
    Repeat until P<0
        If 2^P<=D then
            put 1 into column P
            subtract 2^P from D 
        Else
            put 0 into column P 
        End if
        Subtract 1 from P
